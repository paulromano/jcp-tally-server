Dear Editor: \\

Please find attached for your kind review our manuscript entitled ``Data
decomposition of Monte Carlo particle transport simulations via tally servers''.

This manuscript concerns the development of a novel algorithm for decomposing
tally data in Monte Carlo simulations of large fissioning systems such as
commercial light-water reactors. These problems may have extreme memory
requirements (terabytes) that cannot be handled by existing algorithms used on
contemporary computer hardware. The algorithm we present within allows these
large memory requirements to be split up over many nodes, thereby circumventing
classical node memory constraints.\\
